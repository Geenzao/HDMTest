# HDMTest

I decided to start the test by reading and understanding the code of the project.
Once I understood the code, I started to make the todo.
I started by coding the backend because i thought it would be easier to do the frontend with the backend already done.
The only problem with starting with the backend is that i didn't know if it was working.
I had to finich the frontend to be able to test the backend.

I encountered a few issues when I was trying to run the application because i didn't know the backend and the frontend were supossed to run in the same time.
But that was not a big deal because i just had to run the backend and the frontend in the same time.
It was the only big issue i had.

I add toasts to inform the user if something went wrong. That helped me to know if the code was working or not.

When i did finish all the todos and that i could create and delete tasks, i started to work on the modification of a task.

I struggled a bit to find how to check if the task name already exists when i want to modify or add a task.
I wanted to modify the backend but i didn't find how to do it.
So i just modified the frontend to be able to do what i wanted. I searched how to do it on the internet and i found the "some" method.
It's a method that allowed me to check in a array if an element respect a condition. In this case, if a task with the same name already exists.

I also add a check box to be able to check or uncheck a task. If the task is checked, it means that the task is done and the data is saved in the database.

And i added a search bar to be able to search a task by its name.
